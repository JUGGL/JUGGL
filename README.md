## Welcome
This is the site for the Java Users Group of Greater Louisville, a.k.a. JUGGL. We are a group of developers and
enthusiasts who are interested in learning about [Java](http://www.java.com/), the Java Virtual Machine, and all of the
things you can do on top of the JVM. This includes, but it not necessarily limited to:

* Java Development
* JavaEE - Java Enterprise Edition
* JavaScript development with Nashorn
* Dynamic languages on the JVM: JRuby, Jython, Ceylon, PHP, etc...
* Purpose built languages for the JVM: Scala, Clojure, Kotlin, etc...
